# Multi-cycle Processor Project

Throughout the Fall 2022 Semester, I worked on a processor design for Computer Engineering 381, Computer Architecture. Throughout this project, I learned a lot about computers as a whole and how low-level functionality can hinder security if not designed correctly. I also learned how to work on a large project like this with a teammate to work through the design of the processor without redoing work and managing time conflicts.

The source code can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/jstemps02/381-project).
